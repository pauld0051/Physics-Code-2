## DESCRIPTION

- **Physics Code**
is an educational website aimed at bringing free IB Physics based content to students and teachers worldwide in a simple and aesthetically pleasing manner.
The site will be set up to appear more like a textbook, with simple to read pages, large fonts and easy to identify cards. Each card will be presented with labels and images to help direct the student to making the correct input for their desired result.

The current site is under construction and will remain so for at least until mid 2023. The site is free for you to use but the results can not be guaranteed while still in alpha-phase.

### Known Issues

Samsung Keyboard users can not enter in a negative number when using an input with the type "number". This leads to an impossible outcome for Samsung Keyboard users where a negative number could be essential. This occurs in numerous locations, but was first noticed with the [suvat calculator](https://pauld0051.github.io/Physics-Code-2/suvat.html) and corrected by allowing an input type "text" but limiting it with a pattern (-?[0-9]\d*(\.\d+)?).
