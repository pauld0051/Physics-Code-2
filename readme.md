## DESCRIPTION

- **Physics Code**
is an educational website aimed at bringing free IB Physics based content to students and teachers worldwide in a simple and aesthetically pleasing manner.
The site will be set up to appear more like a textbook, with simple to read pages, large fonts and easy to identify cards. Each card will be presented with labels and images to help direct the student to making the correct input for their desired result.

The current site is under construction and will remain so for at least until mid 2023. The site is free for you to use but the results can not be guaranteed while still in alpha-phase.
